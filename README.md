## 🌌 Gitty!
💡 When the **Open Source Hackfest** threw down the challenge to craft something that "_promotes the principle of sharing knowledge for the benefit of the wider community_", our brains sparked! What combines the vast universe of GitHub with the smartness of ChatGPT? Enter **"Gitty"!** 🚀          featuring🌐**Streamlit**, 🌱**MongoDB**, and ☁️**Google Cloud**!

## 🖥️ What it does
**Imagine having a personal guide for any GitHub repository.** 🌟 Gitty lets you toss in a GitHub repository URL, and in return, it unfurls a rich tapestry of information 📊 – from stars to collaborators, commit histories, and more. Dive deeper with our chatbox, powered by OpenAI's GPT, and ask **ANYTHING** about the repo. Curious about those fancy graphics and data? We got 'em! 📈

## 🛠️ How we built it
Set in a GitHub repository, "Gitty" boasts a strong backbone:
- 🐍 **Python**: Our trusty tool for coding magic.
- 🤖 **ChatGPT**: The genius answering your queries.
- 🌐 **Streamlit**: Giving life to our UI.
- ☁️ **MongoDB Atlas** on **Google Cloud**: Remembering every repository our users adore. 

## 😅 Challenges we ran into
MongoDB was our Everest! 🏔️ Starting from base camp (aka zero knowledge), we faced the daunting task of connecting this mammoth of a database to our sleek app.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
High fives all around 🙌, as we finally made "Gitty" and MongoDB chat like old pals!

## 📚 What we learned
It was an adrenaline-pumping weekend 🎢! We now know MongoDB's nooks and crannies and the art of melding it seamlessly with our app.
